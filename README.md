# GrindMal — Projects Registry

Welcome to **GrindMal Projects**!

This repository is the **central index** of all projects used in GrindMal cycles.  
Projects can be:

- **Broken projects** — with bugs or reproducible issues
- **Collaboration projects** — open-source features, improvements, or modules seeking contributors

---

## Purpose

GrindMal is a **community-driven learning platform**. Projects here are designed for:

- Learning by contributing
- Collaborating in real-world code
- Practicing review, fork, PR, and merge cycles

Everything is tracked, versioned, and transparent.  
Your project becomes part of the system once submitted and approved.

---

## How GrindMal Works (Loop)

1. Submit a project using the Issue template
2. Project is reviewed for clarity and scope
3. Contributors fork the project
4. Fixes / contributions are submitted as PRs
5. PRs are reviewed using **GrindMal Review Guidelines**
6. Accepted contributions are merged
7. Project is marked as solved, complete, or ongoing

Learning happens by **doing and reviewing**, not hand-holding.

## Repository Structure

- `SUBMISSION.md` → rules for submitting projects
- `projects.json` → official registry of accepted projects
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` → enforces structured submissions

---

## Rules (Read Carefully)

- Help = Pull Request / Contribution
- Opinions without code are ignored
- Disputes resolved via alternative PRs, not comments
- No private help channels, no mentors
- No tutorials or hand-holding

This system **filters self-directed grinders**.  
If you are here to “feel comfortable,” GrindMal is not for you.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the project you want to help with.
2. Make your changes in a branch, keep commits small and meaningful.
3. Submit a Pull Request referencing the issue/project.
4. Write a short explanation for your change in the PR description.
5. Expect feedback via the **GrindMal Review Guidelines** — reviews are artifacts, not opinions.
6. Repeat until your PR is approved and merged.
