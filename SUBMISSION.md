# Project Submission Rules

This repo accepts **any project that contributors can meaningfully work on**, including:

- Broken projects with a bug or reproducible issue
- Open-source projects seeking collaboration on features or improvements

---

## Mandatory Requirements

Your project MUST:

- Be hosted on a **public GitHub repository**
- Contain a **clear problem or goal**
- Include **steps to reproduce the issue or contribution scope**
- Provide **expected behavior / outcome**
- Be **solvable or contributable** by others without direct hand-holding

---

## Recommended Scope

- Small modules or tasks inside larger projects
- Clearly defined bugs or features
- Easy-to-understand structure for first-time contributors

---

## Not Allowed

- Vague, undefined, or impossible tasks
- Projects requiring paid APIs or secrets
- Projects that are entirely tutorial-based
- Personal assignments without meaningful contribution potential

---

## Files in Your Repo

Each submitted project should ideally include:

- `README.md` → project overview, setup instructions
- `BUG.md` or `TASK.md` → clear description of problem, feature, or contribution goal

> Do NOT include full solutions or spoilers. The community will fork, contribute, and review.
